# Algorithm for file updates in Python

## Project description

You are a cybersecurity analyst working at a bank. As part of your job, you’re required to regularly update a file that identifies the customers who can access sensitive financial data. The contents of the file are based on who is authorized to view their own account information and transactions. Customers are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses allowed to log into the secure online banking portal. There’s also a remove list that identifies which customers you must revoke from this allow list.

Your task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, you should remove those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list.

## Open the file that contains the allow list

![](data:image/png;base64...)

## Read the file contents

![](data:image/png;base64...)

## Convert the string into a list

![](data:image/png;base64...)

## Iterate through the remove list

![](data:image/png;base64...)

## Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list

![](data:image/png;base64...)

## Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses

![](data:image/png;base64...)

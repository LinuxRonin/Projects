## Projects
1. **[Project Name 1]** – Brief description of the project’s objective, techniques used (e.g., convolutional neural networks, decision trees), and key results or metrics.  
2. **[Project Name 2]** – Brief description of the project’s objective, dataset, and model evaluation approach (e.g., cross‑validation, hyperparameter tuning).  
3. **[Project Name 3]** – Brief description of the project’s goal, feature engineering steps, and performance summary.

## Getting Started
To run any of these projects locally, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

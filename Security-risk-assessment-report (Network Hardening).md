| **Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement** |
| --- |
| The three hardening tools that I am selecting to implement are going to be Multifactor Authorization (MFA), Password policies, & Firewall Maintenance. |
|

| **Part 2: Explain your recommendations** |
| --- |
| The reason for these recommendations is because: the company is lacking is multifactor authorization for its employees which opens them up to cyber attacks due to lack of second authentication security to confirm that the source of the access is in fact the person who is authorized to be in the system.  Secondly, the reason for the recommendation in password policies change is the fact that the company not only uses the same default admin password for their database which is INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS, but the employees also share passwords which may be of convenience but, history shows that this leads to catastrophic consequences.  Lastly, the company requires a firewall overhaul to their maintenance because it was found that they do not have any rules in place to filter traffic coming in or out of the network or server. This is unacceptable and opens them up to any kind of amateur attack not to include: DDOS, IP spoof, Man-In-The-middle, Phishing, Vishing, the list can go on forever of what happens when you leave your network open to be able to be listened on and the packets tracked via software like Wireshark. |

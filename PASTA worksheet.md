| **Stages** | **Sneaker company** |
| --- | --- |
| **I. Define business and security objectives** | * *Due to the application requiring the use of banking information from users to perform transactions for sneakers there will have to be preventative put into place such as encryption, proper storage of data, and the following of the PCI SSC standards for card transactions.* |
| **II. Define the technical scope** | * *Application programming interface (API)* * *Public key infrastructure (PKI)* * *SHA-256* * *SQL*   We are choosing to prioritize these technologies for our testing because all of these technologies if not properly installed, programmed, or configured will be practically inert to hackers and will leave all of customers data open for copying and leakage. |
| **III. Decompose application** | [data flow diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ol7y79popTFfNHM-90ES-H-i1Lpd0YNvPShxBlXozjg/template/preview?resourcekey=0-DZAkf7Vzh2PXsP-j3oXV-g) |
| **IV. Threat analysis** | * *The internal threats would be: Misuse of access by employees whether on purpose or accident.* * *The external threats would be: Skimming or Ransomware attacks* |
| **V. Vulnerability analysis** | * *Improper coding or errors in the code structure such as in SQL could provide errors that will lead to vulnerabilities.* * *The network itself could have misconfiguration issues, too many admin users leading to mishaps, the usage of super admin rather than “sudo”* |
| **VI. Attack modeling** | [attack tree diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FmWLyHgmq9XQoVuMxOym2PHO8IuedCkan4moYnI-EJ0/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-zYPY7AhPJdcClXamlAfOag) |
| **VII. Risk analysis and impact** | Some security controls that could be put into place are: Encryptions such as using TLS and SHA-256, implementation of an IDS/IPS system, access control, Multi-Factor Authentication, and Audits |

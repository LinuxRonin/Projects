**Incident summary:** A sales manager shared access to a folder of internal-only documents with their team during a meeting. The folder contained files associated with a new product that has not been publicly announced. It also included customer analytics and promotional materials. After the meeting, the manager did not revoke access to the internal folder, but warned the team to wait for approval before sharing the promotional materials with others.

During a video call with a business partner, a member of the sales team forgot the warning from their manager. The sales representative intended to share a link to the promotional materials so that the business partner could circulate the materials to their customers. However, the sales representative accidentally shared a link to the internal folder instead. Later, the business partner posted the link on their company's social media page assuming that it was the promotional materials.

| **Control** | **Least privilege** | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Issue(s)** | *The factors that contributed to this incident (leak) is that the manager did not utilize the least privilege principle effectively and did not check effectively to ensure that what they were sharing , and showing to another outside agency/partner/client was properly vetted and/or cleaned to not have any confidential or restricted data that is not needed for the transaction.* | | |
| **Review** | *NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 is a security control that implements the principle of least privilege. This means that users and processes are granted only the privileges that are necessary to perform their assigned tasks. This helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.* | | |
| **Recommendation(s)** | * Restrict access to sensitive resources based on user role. * Automatically revoke access to information after a period of time. * Keep activity logs of provisioned user accounts. * Regularly audit user privileges. | | |
| **Justification** | *These improvements will prevent leaks from happening because when you restrict access based on user roles then you limit the amount of data a person is allowed to see and therefore, potentially leak accidentally or on purpose. Also whenever you do end up having a leak or there are reports of potential leaks in the data structure you are able to automatically revoke access to only data owners and this will allow you the proper time to review all of your activity logs to see the who,when,where and then from this information found out the why.* | | |

### **Security plan snapshot**

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) uses a hierarchical, tree-like structure to organize information. From left to right, it describes a broad security function, then becomes more specific as it branches out to a category, subcategory, and individual security controls.

| **Function** | **Category** | **Subcategory** | **Reference(s)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Protect** | PR.DS: *Data security* | PR.DS-5: *Protections against data leaks.* | NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 |

In this example, the implemented controls that are used by the manufacturer to protect against data leaks are defined in NIST SP 800-53â€”a set of guidelines for securing the privacy of information systems.

**Note:** References are commonly hyperlinked to the guidelines or regulations they relate to. This makes it easy to learn more about how a particular control should be implemented. It's common to find multiple links to different sources in the references columns.

### **NIST SP 800-53: AC-6**

NIST developed SP 800-53 to provide businesses with a customizable information privacy plan. It's a comprehensive resource that describes a wide range of control categories. Each control provides a few key pieces of information:

* **Control:** A definition of the security control.
* **Discussion:** A description of how the control should be implemented.
* **Control enhancements:** A list of suggestions to improve the effectiveness of the control.

| **AC-6** | **Least Privilege** |
| --- | --- |
| Control:  Only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task or function should be provided to users. |
| Discussion:  Processes, user accounts, and roles should be enforced as necessary to achieve least privilege. The intention is to prevent a user from operating at privilege levels higher than what is necessary to accomplish business objectives. |
| Control enhancements:   * Restrict access to sensitive resources based on user role. * Automatically revoke access to information after a period of time. * Keep activity logs of provisioned user accounts. * Regularly audit user privileges. |

**Note:** In the category of access controls, SP 800-53 lists least privilege sixth, i.e. AC-6.

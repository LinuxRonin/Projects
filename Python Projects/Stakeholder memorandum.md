SUBJECT: Internal IT Audit Findings and Recommendations

Dear Colleagues,

Please review the following information regarding the Botium Toys internal audit scope, goals, critical findings, summary and recommendations.

**Scope:**

● Current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, end point

detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information and event

management (SIEM) tool.

● Current implemented controls in the following systems: accounting, end point

detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event

Management (SIEM) tool.

● Current procedures and protocols set for the following systems: accounting,

end point detection, firewall, intrusion detection system, Security Information

and Event Management (SIEM) tool.

● Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place

align with necessary compliance requirements.

● Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.

**Goals:**

● To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity

Framework (NIST CSF)

● Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant

● Fortify system controls

● Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential

management

● Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks

● Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements

**Critical findings** (must be addressed immediately): Critical findings found on the internal audit that need to be addressed immediately due to high priority ratings due to damage that can be caused with noncompliance.

* Disaster Recovery Plans
* Password Policies
* Access Control Policies
* Intrusion Detection System
* Encryption
* Backups
* Locks
* Fire Detection / Prevention

**Findings** (should be addressed, but no immediate need):

* Account Management Policies
* Separation of Duties
* Password Management System
* Time Controlled Safe
* Adequate Lighting
* Signage Indicating Alarm Device

**Summary/Recommendations:**

Based on the three regulations and standards that Botium Toys falls under: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), & System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2) they need to drastically increase their compliance in all sectors especially those highlighted above as **critical.** The reason for this is because this company is looking to expand their markets into the European markets which are more strict for customers privacy and rights and Botium cannot securely ensure the safety of their customers information physically or digitally for the current home market. Security needs to be fully revamped aggressively to ensure the effectiveness of the company and the future extension of their markets.

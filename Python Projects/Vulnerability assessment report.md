**Vulnerability Assessment Report**

**1st November 2023**

# System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

# Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2023 to August 2023. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

# Purpose

Consider the following questions to help you write:

* *How is the database server valuable to the business?*
* **A database server is important and valuable to the business because it holds all of the information that is vital to the security, and financial stability of operations.**
* *Why is it important for the business to secure the data on the server?*
* ***It is important for a business to secure the data on a server because of they do not then this leaves bad actors unfeathered access to unlimited data in operations, clients, and other extremely sensitive data.***
* *How might the server impact the business if it were disabled?*
* **If a server were shut down and theoretically not backed up or a secondary was not in place then this would cripple the company for however long it would take to revive the server and/or components. The reason for this is because your server is the heart of your company and any important files that you may need for contingency operations, or continuation of services to customers / clients**

# Risk Assessment

| **Threat source** | **Threat event** | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Risk** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Outsider: Hacker* | *Conduct DDOS attacks* | *3* | *3* | *9* |
| *Hardware* | *Failure of equipment* | *2* | *2* | *4* |
| *Extreme Weather* | *Disrupt mission critical events* | *1* | *3* | *3* |

# Approach

Risks considered the data storage and management methods of the business. The likelihood of a threat occurrence and the impact of these potential events were weighed against the risks to day-to-day operational needs.

# Remediation Strategy

Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.

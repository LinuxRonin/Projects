In this project we will be using SQL in linux to obtain information based on a scenario where our cybersecurity team needs data to be able to investigate security issues and update its computers.

## Retrieve login attempts on specific dates

* To retrieve multiple dates you use the command of ‘OR’ with two different dates or or you may use ‘AND’

## Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico

## A picture containing text Description automatically generated

* To retrieve results from outside of a specific country you must use the ‘NOT’ command.

## Retrieve employees in Marketing

* Here we are using the special character of ‘%’ in the ‘LIKE’ command because there are multiple buildings with multiple numbers and we would like to see them all.

## Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales

* To specify between two objectives you would use the ‘OR’ command only

## Retrieve all employees not in IT

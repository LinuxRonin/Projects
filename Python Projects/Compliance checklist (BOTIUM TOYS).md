The FERC-NERC regulation applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid.

GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. citizens’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. Additionally, if a breach occurs and a E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed within 72 hours of the incident.

**Explanation:** NOT IN COMPLIANCE

* The GDPR requires that a company to not only be transparent about their right to privacy but the protection of their information and data as well. Botium Toys does not adhere to these standards due to the security audit findings that there are inadequate control policies, password policies, encryptions, and separations of duties that will eventually lead to a severe breach in the future.
* **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**

PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment.

**Explanation:** NOT IN COMPLIANCE

* Botium Toys are grossly out of compliance with this standard due to the blatant lack of physical security, lack of protection of digital assets and even physical assets from natural disasters including the backup of servers securely to be able to keep running operations and customers information within standards.

Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

**Explanation:** NOT IN COMPLIANCE.
